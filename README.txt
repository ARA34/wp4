Welcome to my WP4 project.
In this project you can enter the name of any artist that is in the LasfFM API
and get data on the amount of times their tracks have been played
and the percentage that those playcounts have contributed to the artist
total career playcounts in a pie chart.

How to use:
1. Run [python3 wp4.py]
2. Enter the name of an artist in the LastFM database
3. Enter the name of a title
4. You're done!
5. Check out your cool pie chart in the data_images folder created for you.
